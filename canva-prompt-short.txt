Create a light, minimal portfolio website design with the following specifications:

COLOR SCHEME:
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) or soft off-white (#FAFAFA)
- Text: Dark charcoal gray (#2C2C2C) for readability
- Accents: Soft, muted tones (light blue-gray, soft lavender, or warm beige) - avoid bright colors
- Borders: Very light gray (#E5E5E5)

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Modern sans-serif font (Inter, Poppins, or Montserrat)
- Large, bold headings (48-64px for hero)
- Clean body text (16-18px) with generous line spacing (1.6-1.8)
- Generous letter spacing for headings

LAYOUT:

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Generous white space (40-60px minimum between sections)
- Subtle shadows only (very soft, avoid harsh drops)
- Thin borders (1px) where needed
- Minimal line-style icons

SECTIONS TO INCLUDE:

2. Hero/Introduction
3. About Me
4. Skills/Technologies
5. Projects/Portfolio

7. Footer

STYLE: Think Apple website aesthetic - clean, modern, minimal, with focus on content readability and visual breathing room. Avoid dark colors, busy patterns, and cluttered layouts.
